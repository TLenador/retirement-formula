# Retirement Formula Program

## Overview

This Python program calculates the amount of money needed to retire based on user inputs such as desired buying power upon retirement, years until retirement, and expected interest rates. The program uses a formula that takes into account inflation and investment returns to estimate the required retirement savings.

## Features
- Calculates the total amount needed for retirement based on user inputs.
- Takes into account inflation and investment returns to provide a more accurate estimate.
- Provides a breakdown of the required savings per year to reach the retirement goal.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python if you haven't already.
3. Open the program in a Python IDE or text editor.
4. Run the program and answer the prompts to calculate the retirement savings needed.
## Usage
Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Input your answers, true or hypothetical, to the questions
- The program will calculate the total amount needed for retirement and the annual savings required to reach that goal.
## Example

```Copy code
$ python retirement_calculator.py

If you retired today, how much money do you think you would need each year? 75000
How many years from now do you want to retire? 30
How much money will you invest each year for the next three years? 10000
```

You will need to invest for 30 years to reach your retirement goal.
Starting in three years, this is how much you will need to invest each year to reach your goal: $20,000
