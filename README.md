# Retirement Formula Program

## Overview

This Python program calculates the amount of money needed to retire based on user inputs such as current age, desired retirement age, current savings, and expected annual expenses during retirement. The program uses a formula that takes into account inflation and investment returns to estimate the required retirement savings.

## Features
- Calculates the total amount needed for retirement based on user inputs.
- Takes into account inflation and investment returns to provide a more accurate estimate.
- Provides a breakdown of the required savings per year to reach the retirement goal.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python if you haven't already.
3. Open the program in a Python IDE or text editor.
4. Modify the input variables (current age, desired retirement age, etc.) as needed.
5. Run the program to calculate the retirement savings needed.
## Usage
Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Input your current age, desired retirement age, current savings, and expected annual expenses during retirement.
- The program will calculate the total amount needed for retirement and the annual savings required to reach that goal.
## Example

```Copy code
$ python retirement_calculator.py

Enter your current age: 30
Enter your desired retirement age: 65
Enter your current retirement savings: 50000
Enter your expected annual expenses during retirement: 40000
```

Based on your inputs, you will need $1,000,000 for retirement.
To reach this goal, you need to save $15,000 per year.
